# IT Infrastructure Services - Industry Benchmarks (2024)

## Performance Standards

### Uptime & Availability
- **Industry Average SLA**: 99.0% - 99.5% uptime
- **Top Tier Providers**: 99.7% - 99.9%
- **Below Standard**: < 98.5%

**2024 Trend**: Average uptime has declined 0.3% industry-wide due to:
- Global supply chain disruptions affecting hardware replacement
- Cybersecurity threats requiring more frequent patching/maintenance
- Staff shortage in IT services sector (18% vacancy rate)

### Incident Response
- **Industry Average**: 2.5 hours for critical incident response
- **Best-in-Class**: < 1 hour response time
- **Concerning Threshold**: > 4 hours

### Critical Incidents
- **Typical Rate**: 1-2 critical incidents per quarter
- **Warning Sign**: > 3 critical incidents in 6 months
- **Severe**: > 2 unresolved critical incidents

## Cost Benchmarks (2024)

### Infrastructure Monitoring (24/7)
- **Market Rate Range**: $18,000 - $25,000/month
- **Premium Services**: $28,000 - $35,000/month
- **Budget Options**: $12,000 - $18,000/month

**Note**: Premium pricing justified for:
- 99.9%+ SLA commitments
- Dedicated account management
- Proactive monitoring vs reactive

### Value vs Cost Analysis
- **Below-market pricing** often indicates:
  - Reduced staffing levels
  - Limited monitoring capabilities
  - Shared resources across many clients
  
- **Above-market pricing** should provide:
  - Enhanced SLA guarantees
  - Faster response times
  - Better incident prevention

## Market Conditions (Q2 2024)

### Supply Challenges
- **Hardware Lead Times**: Extended to 8-12 weeks (previously 2-4 weeks)
- **Impact**: Vendors struggling to replace failed equipment quickly
- **Mitigation**: Best vendors maintain emergency spare inventory

### Talent Shortage
- **Security Specialists**: 22% shortage globally
- **Network Engineers**: 18% shortage
- **Impact**: Response time degradation across industry

### Competitive Landscape
- **Vendor Consolidation**: 12% fewer SMB IT service providers than 2023
- **Opportunity**: Larger vendors offering competitive pricing to gain market share
- **Risk**: Service quality may decline as vendors scale

## Risk Assessment Context

### Low Risk Indicators
- Consistent uptime > 99.3%
- < 2 critical incidents/year
- Proactive communication
- Investment in monitoring tools
- Staff retention and training

### Medium Risk Indicators
- Uptime 98.5% - 99.2%
- 2-4 critical incidents/year
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Staff turnover issues
- Budget constraints affecting service

### High Risk Indicators
- Uptime < 98.5%
- > 4 critical incidents/year OR unresolved incidents
- Poor communication/documentation
- Repeated system failures
- Vendor financial instability

## Recommendations for Contract Evaluation

### Context Matters
1. **Compare to Industry Baseline**: A vendor at 98.8% may be "at market" given 2024 challenges, not "failing"
2. **Trend Analysis**: Improving vendor (88% → 94%) may be better than declining vendor (99% → 97%)
3. **Root Cause**: External factors (ISP, supply chain) should be weighted differently than internal failures
4. **Vendor Response**: Quality of incident response often more important than incident occurrence

### When to Terminate vs Renegotiate
- **Terminate**: Pattern of unresolved issues, poor communication, no improvement over 6+ months
- **Renegotiate**: Performance issues but vendor responsive, external factors present, improving trend
- **Monitor**: Borderline performance but strong relationship, recent fixes implemented
- **Renew**: Consistent performance, proactive approach, within budget

### Red Flags (Override Other Factors)
- **Security breaches** due to vendor negligence
- **Unresolved critical incidents** > 30 days
- **Vendor financial instability** (bankruptcy risk)
- **Repeated SLA misses** with no improvement plan
- **Lack of accountability** in incident response

## Comparative Analysis Tools

When evaluating vendors, consider:
1. **Absolute Performance**: Raw metrics vs SLA targets
2. **Relative Performance**: Comparison to industry benchmarks
3. **Trend Direction**: Improving vs declining
4. **Context**: External factors affecting performance
5. **Value Proposition**: Price vs service quality balance
